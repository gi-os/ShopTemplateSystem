# Folder-Driven B2B Storefront

A static-first e-commerce storefront where everything — branding, products, collections, and orders — is driven by a single `DATABASE` folder. Swapping this folder completely rebrands and restocks the site for a different client.

## Features

- **Zero Hardcoded Branding**: All colors, logos, company name, and copy pulled from `DATABASE/Design/`
- **Dynamic Catalog**: Scan `ShopCollections/` subfolders to generate collections and products - no config file needed
- **Box-Based B2B Pricing**: Display box quantities and pricing prominently
- **Cart System**: localStorage-based cart that persists across sessions
- **Flexible Checkout**: Support for LR Paris freight forwarder or custom freight options
- **CSV Order Tracking**: Orders appended to `DATABASE/Orders/orders.csv`

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS (colors injected from `Colors.txt`)
- File-based data (no external database)

```

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the storefront.

### Build

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Swapping DATABASE Folders

To completely rebrand and restock the site for a different client:

1. **Backup the current DATABASE folder** (optional, for reference)
   ```bash
   mv DATABASE DATABASE_backup_client1
   ```

2. **Copy in the new client's DATABASE folder**
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/new/client/DATABASE ./DATABASE
   ```

3. **Restart the development server** (if running)
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The site will now reflect:
- New branding (colors, logos, company name)
- New product catalog
- New collections
- Separate order tracking

**No code changes required!** The folder structure IS the configuration.

### Product Photos

Place product images in the `Photos` subfolder:
- Images will be displayed in alphabetical order

- First image is used as the main product image

## Order Management

Orders are stored in `DATABASE/Orders/` as individual JSON files. Each order contains:

- Order ID and timestamp
- Customer information (name, email, company, phone, address)
- Order items with quantities and pricing
- Order summary and totals
- Special instructions/notes

See `DATABASE/Orders/README.md` for complete order file format documentation.

## Version System

The Shop Template System uses a custom versioning scheme:

**Current Version:** `STS-0.14`

**Format:** `STS-X.YY`
- STS = Shop Template System prefix
- X = Major version (0 for development)
- YY = Minor version (increments by 01 for each update)

Version is displayed in:
- Footer on all pages
- About page (`/about`)
- System information

See `VERSIONING.md` for complete versioning documentation and how to increment versions.

## Documentation

Comprehensive README files are included throughout the codebase:

- `DATABASE/README.md` - Overview of data structure
- `DATABASE/Design/README.md` - Branding and design system
- `DATABASE/ShopCollections/README.md` - Product catalog structure
- `app/README.md` - Next.js app structure
- `lib/README.md` - Utility functions
- `components/README.md` - React components

Each subfolder contains detailed documentation for exact file formats and specifications.
